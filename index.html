          <h3>Property Tax Reforms for Policymakers</h3>August 2024<br>
          <p>From Nebraska to Colorado to Indiana, property tax is top of mind for policymakers and political candidates. The following is a set of common-sense reforms for policymakers seeking to create a fair and equitable property tax system.</p>
          <p><strong>Property tax relief should be broadly distributed to both residential and commercial property taxpayers.</strong> Policymakers should end assessment ratio and tax rate preferences for residential property. These preferences may make for good kitchen-table politics, but the preferences leave taxing jurisdictions susceptible to risk from volatility in commercial property values, e.g., Boston's current troubles amid a slump in commercial property valuations.</p>
          <p><strong>Shift property tax assessment methodology from a focus on the sales comparison and income approaches to value to the cost approach.</strong> The cost approach to value is less susceptible to the ups and downs of the broader market. States should adopt the Nevada approach to property tax assessment to remove the volatility associated with business cycles.</p>
          <p><strong>Adopt a taxable value, a cap on taxable value growth, and a taxable value factor to manage equity over time.</strong> Shifting to a cost approach to value is only one step in reforming a property tax system. States should also adopt a taxable value (a value that is the product of the cost approach value conclusion and the current taxable value factor) and a cap on taxable value growth (e.g., Arizona's 5% cap or Oregon's 3% cap).</p>
          <p>This type of system will almost always result in the net assessed taxable value growing year-on-year which provides tax rate setting authorities the political room to increase the overall levy while decreasing the tax rate or holding it flat. This is particularly useful during downturns in the business cycle. For example, Maricopa County was able to reduce its tax rate this year despite a reduction in market values since the net assessed taxable value increased year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The last piece, a taxable value factor to manage equity over time, is crucial. Maricopa County, AZ does this well, especially when considering equity across a property category, construction class and rank, and effective age.</p>
          <p>These reforms create an <strong>equitable distribution of the property tax burden across all taxpayers</strong> and provide a <strong>predictable path for assessments and tax bills</strong>, thereby creating a climate for private sector investment and the resulting growth in the property tax base.</p>
