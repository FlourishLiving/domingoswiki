        <h3>Property Tax Reforms for Policymakers</h3>
        <p>From Nebraska to Colorado to Indiana, property tax is top of mind for policymakers and political candidates.
          The following is a set of common-sense reforms for policymakers seeking to create a fair and equitable
          property tax system.</p>
        <p><strong>Property tax relief should be broadly distributed to both residential and commercial property
            taxpayers.</strong> Policymakers should end assessment ratio and tax rate preferences for residential
          property. These preferences may make for good kitchen-table politics, but the preferences leave taxing
          jurisdictions susceptible to risk from volatility in commercial property values, e.g., Boston's current
          troubles amid a slump in commercial property valuations.</p>
        <p><strong>Shift property tax assessment methodology from a focus on the sales comparison and income approaches
            to value to the cost approach.</strong> The cost approach to value is less susceptible to the ups and downs
          of the broader market. States should adopt the Nevada approach to property tax assessment to remove the
          volatility associated with business cycles.</p>
        <p><strong>Adopt a taxable value, a cap on taxable value growth, and a taxable value factor to manage equity
            over time.</strong> Shifting to a cost approach to value is only one step in reforming a property tax
          system. States should also adopt a taxable value (a value that is the product of the cost approach value
          conclusion and the current taxable value factor) and a cap on taxable value growth (e.g., Arizona's 5% cap or
          Oregon's 3% cap).</p>
        <p>This type of system will almost always result in the net assessed taxable value growing year-on-year which
          provides tax rate setting authorities the political room to increase the overall levy while decreasing the tax
          rate or holding it flat. This is particularly useful during downturns in the business cycle. For example,
          Maricopa County was able to reduce its tax rate this year despite a reduction in market values since the net
          assessed taxable value increased year-on-year.</p>
        <p>The last piece, a taxable value factor to manage equity over time, is crucial. Maricopa County, AZ does this
          well, especially when considering equity across a property category, construction class and rank, and
          effective age.</p>
        <p>These reforms create an <strong>equitable distribution of the property tax burden across all
            taxpayers</strong> and provide a <strong>predictable path for assessments and tax bills</strong>, thereby
          creating a climate for private sector investment and the resulting growth in the property tax base.</p>
